Simulator for the [Haba Erster Obstgarten](https://www.haba.de/de_DE/meine-ersten-spiele-erster-obstgarten--004655) game. 
After playing a few times I was curious of what is the likelihood of winning.
After spending 10 minutes trying to model it with Markov chains I decided that it was faster to just simulate it 20M times and see what the distribution was.
